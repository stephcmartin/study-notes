# What is a Closure?
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). 
In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. 
In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

To use a closure, simply define a function inside another function and expose it. 
To expose a function, return it or pass it to another function.

The inner function will have access to the variables in the outer function scope, 
even after the outer function has returned.
